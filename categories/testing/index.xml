However, I would not advise a complete rewrite of your project in Groovy!
We can however use Groovy to test our Java code.
I&amp;rsquo;m actually a big fan of this approach. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it to test legacy applications written in Java.
I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t use lambdas or fancy Java 8 features but all of a sudden, my test code was more expressive. I could take advantage closures, power asserts, the Spock DSL and Groovy simple syntax.</description></item><item><title>Integration tests with a Docker JUnit Rule</title><link>https://geowarin.github.io/integration-tests-with-a-docker-junit-rule/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://geowarin.github.io/integration-tests-with-a-docker-junit-rule/</guid><description>When writing integration tests, you might have to run a third party server or middleware. Your tests should remain fast to run and you should be able to run them from your IDE.
Docker seems a good choice for this task!
I just published a small library that contains a JUnit rule allowing you to start Docker containers before your unit tests.
If that sounds of interest to you, you should give it a try and tell me what you think!</description></item></channel></rss>

On the repo, the authors give instructions to run the tool, a node application, via docker-compose.
On the other hand, the website whose analytics will be tracked needs to include a script that will look like this:
&amp;lt;script async src=&amp;#34;https://unpkg.com/ackee-tracker@3.2.2/dist/ackee-tracker.min.js&amp;#34; data-ackee-server=&amp;#34;https://ackee.com&amp;#34; data-ackee-domain-id=&amp;#34;67bfa855-7569-4d29-a0a3-a2f4ceae2ea3&amp;#34; data-ackee-opts=&amp;#39;{ &amp;#34;ignoreLocalhost&amp;#34;: false }&amp;#39;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; The problem is that localhost:1313, where my blog runs locally, cannot send json requests to https:localhost or whichever host Ackee is running on, if they differ in name/port, etc.</description></item><item><title>What I Did Wrong as a CTO</title><link>https://geowarin.github.io/what-i-did-wrong-as-a-cto/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2018 11:33:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://geowarin.github.io/what-i-did-wrong-as-a-cto/</guid><description>Being a CTO in a startup is much more than the technical side.
However, the technical decisions you make early with software, especially in a timed-constraint environment like a startup, tend to stick with you for the rest of the project.
In this article, I will be listing a few of the technical decisions I made.
Some of them felt right at all time, some of them I hope not to make again.</description></item></channel></rss>

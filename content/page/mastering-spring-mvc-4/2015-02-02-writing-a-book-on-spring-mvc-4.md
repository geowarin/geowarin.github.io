Good news everyone!

After reviewing the awesome [Learning Spring Boot](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-spring-boot) by [Greg Lee Turnquist](https://twitter.com/gregturn),
Packt Publishing asked me to write a book of my own on Spring MVC 4.

Of course I said! I just signed the contract and I'm getting ready for five months of intense writing with a publishing date somewhere around
the last quarter of 2015.

I'm glad to seize this opportunity to answer the questions you guys have been asking me after the publication of
[my article on spring MVC]({% post_url 2013-01-23-complete-example-of-a-spring-mvc-3-2-project %}) last year.

Here is a peek of the topics I will cover in the book:

**Master Spring MVC 4**

1. Setting up a Spring web application in no time
2. Mastering the MVC Architecture
3. Handling forms and complex URL mapping
4. Crafting a RESTful application
5. Leaving nothing to luck: Unit tests and Acceptance Tests
6. Securing your application
7. Optimizing your requests
8. Deploying to the cloud
9. Beyond Spring Web

I hope that you like the outline and that the book will help you achieve ultimate mastery of Spring MVC!

I created a section on the blog where you can [follow my progress](/mastering-spring-mvc4.html).

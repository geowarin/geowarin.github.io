In this chapter of [Mastering Spring MVC 4](/mastering-spring-mvc4.html), we’ll tackle main principles of a RESTful architecture. We’ll learn how to convert data to JSON and handle different media types in the application.

We will use the JSR-310 (Java DateTime) spec from the get-go and see how
to handle them properly in your MVC application.

## Forever RESTful

We will see how REST works in theory: HTTP codes and verbs, API versioning, HATEOAS, etc.

Then, we will design an API that uses both JSON and XML to do a twitter search
and manage users.

## Tooling

I will also show you some useful tools to debug REST API.
My favorite one is a little command line tool called [httpie](http://httpie.org/).

You will study the best practice like exceptions handling and custom
error pages.

We will also see how to set up Jackson serialization using mixins and Java 8 dates.

## Documentation

We will use [swagger](http://swagger.io/) to document our API.

Hello, dear visitor! I think I have an idea of what you want...
  
You want to learn how to create a complete Spring web application with
oauth support, security, file upload and distributed sessions.

You want to master the principles of REST and develop a clean API with top-notch
exception handling and following the best practices.

You also want to deploy it in the cloud and for it to be fully tested with
both unit and end-to-end tests.

What a coincidence! I just wrote the book
[you are looking for](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-spring-mvc-4)!

If you want to have a look at what you will be building,
its source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Mastering-Spring-MVC-4)
and it is deployed [on heroku](http://masterspringmvc.herokuapp.com/)

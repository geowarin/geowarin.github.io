This is a short note on how to share your intelliJ run configurations with git.

First your `.gitignore` must whitelist the `.idea/runConfigurations` folder but not the rest of the `.idea` folder.

You probably don't want to commit the entire folder because it can contain personal settings and plugin configurations.

```gitignore
!.idea

.idea/*
!.idea/runConfigurations
```

Here is a compound run configuration. It's awesome. It launches multiple run configurations at once.

Then you want to check the **Share throught VCS** checkbox on the top right corner, this will add an xml file to the
`.idea/runConfigurations` file that you can commit and push.

By default, when you try to debug project reactor calls, you get something like this:

![No debug](/assets/images/articles/2019/2019-12-20-webflux-no-debug.png)

But if you add this dependency :

```kotlin
testImplementation("io.projectreactor:reactor-tools")
```

And click on this little funnel:

![Funnel](/assets/images/articles/2019/2019-12-20-funnel.png)

Also ensure that you have the reactor plugin and that its properly configured.

![Plugin config](/assets/images/articles/2019/2019-12-22-webflux-config.png)

You get this:

![Wow](/assets/images/articles/2019/2019-12-20-clean-stack.png)

Much better!

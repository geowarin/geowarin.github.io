Your tests should remain fast to run and you should be able to run them from your IDE.
Docker seems a good choice for this task!
I just published a small library that contains a JUnit rule allowing you to start Docker containers before your unit tests.
If that sounds of interest to you, you should give it a try and tell me what you think!</description></item></channel></rss>

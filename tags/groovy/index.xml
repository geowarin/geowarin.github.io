However, I would not advise a complete rewrite of your project in Groovy!
We can however use Groovy to test our Java code.
I&amp;rsquo;m actually a big fan of this approach. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it to test legacy applications written in Java.
I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t use lambdas or fancy Java 8 features but all of a sudden, my test code was more expressive. I could take advantage closures, power asserts, the Spock DSL and Groovy simple syntax.</description></item><item><title>Spring Boot and React hot loader</title><link>https://geowarin.github.io/spring-boot-and-react-hot-loader/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://geowarin.github.io/spring-boot-and-react-hot-loader/</guid><description>When I develop web applications, I love using React. I&amp;rsquo;m also a Spring and groovy addict.
Those two stacks make me more productive. Can we have the best of both worlds?
I will show you step by step how I created this project. Feel free to fiddle with it and give me your feedback.
Goal My perfect stack on the backend is to use Spring boot and groovy. With the latest version of Spring boot, there is a new tool called dev-tools that will automatically reload the embedded server when you recompile your project.</description></item></channel></rss>

I created a little chat application with Spring Boot, you can see the result on github.
There is a docker-compose file at the root of the project that you can use to run a RethinkDB instance instead of installing it directly on your machine.
Why RethinkDB? I already gave RethinkDB a try a few months ago and I was very impressed with its beautiful admin GUI, its clustering capabilities and its clever and intuitive API.</description></item></channel></rss>

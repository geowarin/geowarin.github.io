<p>Here are my favorite refactorings, I&rsquo;m using IntelliJ for the screencast, but most of this
will be available in VSCode as well.</p>
<h2 id="rename">Rename</h2>
<p>If I had to take a single refactoring to a desert island, it would be the &ldquo;rename&rdquo; refactoring.</p>
<p>With a typed language, you have no reasons not to use this.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="images/rename.gif"
         alt="Rename (Shift&#43;F6)"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Rename (Shift+F6)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>IntelliJ has smart renames and understand getter/setter paradigms.</p>
<p>Compared to <code>Ctrl+R</code> or other manual replace actions, your editor will make sure that you correctly select
the relevant variables/methods, as well as being a lot faster.</p>
<h2 id="extract-component">Extract component</h2>
<p>This refactoring is a real MVP. This enables a whole workflow for me: when I prototype, I lay down all the HTML
until it looks right. Then I can extract subcomponents with a simple keybinding.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="images/extract-component.gif"
         alt="Extract component (no default keybinding)"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Extract component (no default keybinding)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have bound this refactoring to <code>Ctlr+Alt+Shift+M</code> because it resembles the extract method refactoring (<code>Ctlr+Alt+M</code>).</p>
<p>You should definitely check out the <code>Extract method</code> refactoring, by the way 😀.</p>
<h2 id="extract-variable">Extract variable</h2>
<p>This will allow you to add meaningful names to your code in a heartbeat.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="images/extract-var.gif"
         alt="Extract variable (Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;V)"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Extract variable (Ctrl+Alt+V)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I should have checked the <code>const</code> checkbox here, to have a <code>const</code> variable generated,
instead of a <code>let</code>. 🤦‍</p>
<h2 id="extract-type">Extract type</h2>
<p>The extract variable refactoring also works on types!</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="images/extract-type.gif"
         alt="Extract type (Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;V)"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Extract type (Ctrl+Alt+V)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can then use <code>Alt+Enter</code> to convert the type to an interface if you wish.</p>
<h2 id="move">Move</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m nearly done with my refactoring here, I just need my menu to be in its own file.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="images/move.gif"
         alt="Move (F6)"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Move (F6)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And voilà!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Refactoring can dramatically increase your productivity by providing useful keybindings for complex code
transformations.</p>
<p>They also give you full confidence that the resulting code will be 100% valid.</p>
<p>Finally, while I showed you examples on a small scale, you can probably imagine how much time will
be saved on larger scale refactorings!</p>

Here are some technical decisions I came to regret and those that I would make again in my next project</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a CTO in a startup is much more than the technical side.</p>
<p>However, the technical decisions you make early with software, especially in a timed-constraint environment like a startup,
tend to stick with you for the rest of the project.</p>
<p>In this article, I will be listing a few of the technical decisions I made.</p>
<p>Some of them felt right at all time, some of them I hope not to make again.</p>
<h1 id="the-stack">The stack</h1>
<p>Our project was a SaaS management application. We wanted our users to have a great experience, to distinguish ourselves
from the competition, and improve their productivity.</p>
<p>We used Kotlin and Spring Boot on the backend, React and Typescript on the frontend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really comfortable with those technologies and that&rsquo;s why I chose them.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re only using parts of our stack, I believe that some of the things I learned will be useful to you.</p>
<h1 id="it-felt-right-would-do-again-in-my-next-project">It felt right (would do again in my next project)</h1>
<h2 id="kotlin">Kotlin</h2>
<p>Kotlin is a fantastic language. It takes inspirations from scala, groovy, ruby, keeps the best parts, and has a top notch
IDE support.</p>
<p>There were a few rough edges at the start of the project (IDE performance regressions, erratic behavior on language updates)
but for the past few months I can say without reserve that Kotlin has been nothing but a joy to work with.</p>
<p>Kotlin is Java, had it been designed in the past few years instead of having 20 years of legacy.
Kotlin is Scala, had it been designed to be a productivity powerhouse instead of an academic language.</p>
<p>It is pragmatic, elegant, and with very few footguns. It would be really painful for me to start a new project with
Java instead of Kotlin.</p>
<h2 id="postgres">Postgres</h2>
<p>Postgres is an awesome database. Don&rsquo;t listen to the bells and whistle of NoSQL. I&rsquo;m completely sure that 90% of the
web applications built in 2018 will not require advanced partitioning and clustering and will fit nicely in a relational
database.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building a social network, it&rsquo;s different of course, but otherwise, just take the best relational database.
Your team will probably be at-ease with SQL and you will have the peace of mind of a database schema.</p>
<h2 id="jooq-and-flyway">JOOQ and Flyway</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jooq.org/">JooQ</a> is a java library which allows you to write type-safe SQL queries in Java.</p>
<p><a href="https://flywaydb.org/">Flyway</a> is a very simple tool that handles your database migrations using simple SQL files
(there is a bit more to it, but the concepts are very easy to grasp).</p>
<p>Both are very well designed and it felt liberating to be in control of the SQL of the application.
I came to realize how powerful SQL really is.
All of a sudden it was a world with window functions, views, schemas, users, and more, that was open to us.</p>
<p>I feel like I was never really in control of my schema when using JPA or other ORM tools in the past.</p>
<h2 id="typescript-and-react">Typescript and React</h2>
<p>For most of my career, I&rsquo;ve worked with type-safe languages. I am 100% certain that they make me more productive.
I can refactor my code and I have tremendous tools that empower me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have worked on a JS project without types for 2 years.
It was a successful project with a lot of javascript and a great UX, but it was hard to crank up new features or
change old code.</p>
<p>I will never start a new project without typescript or flow. My heart tells me typescript is the right tool for me, but
choosing any of the type-safe languages that compile to JS will make you more productive.</p>
<p>The only downside with typescript is finding type definitions for some libraries. There are not always of the best quality
and you might have to copy, paste, and modify some locally to get the job done.</p>
<p>I tend to have a bias towards libraries written in typescript: they come with type definitions and often have a better design.</p>
<p>React is a good library. I feel at ease with its API surface and I found that teaching React to newer developers is never
too much of a burden.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-paas">Using a PaaS</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste time setting up docker containers and a Kubernetes cluster. You just started your project, it does not have
to handle billions of requests. You just need to publish your project in one command without headaches.</p>
<p>We used <a href="https://pivotal.io/platform">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> and we would type <code>cf push theApplication.jar</code> and be done
with our deployment.</p>
<h2 id="no-micro-services">No micro-services</h2>
<p>A good old monolith is all you want for the exact same reasons as the above.</p>
<p>Always strive for simplicity. You can create services later on when your startup is widely successful.</p>
<p>Martin Fowler wrote a wonderful article called <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">Monolith First</a>
that I encourage you to read.</p>
<h2 id="not-using-webpack">Not using webpack</h2>
<p>I have a lot of respect for the folks maintaining webpack. It is a good tool with unprecedented possibilities.
That being said, when I set up the project, and despite my two years of webpack experience, I always felt like I was
struggling with legacy software, and weird edge cases.
I had to use or write custom plugins just to overcome the shortcomings of the tool.</p>
<p>Webpack is getting better day after day but, for the sake of the project, I took a look at the competition.</p>
<p>For my JS build, I don&rsquo;t want fancy configuration and a ton of plugins.
I want something like spring-boot, with good defaults, and I want it to be fast out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>We used <a href="https://fuse-box.org/">fuse-box</a>, a very good bundler with an efficient cache.
It is written in typescript and readily supports this language. Two decisive reasons for me.</p>
<p>I never regretted trusting the fuse-box team, they&rsquo;re doing a awesome job and they really listen to their community.</p>
<p>The other tool I am following closely is <a href="https://parceljs.org/">parcel</a>.
It auto-detects the features you need and provide an all-around pleasurable developer experience with no configuration.
And it&rsquo;s faster than Webpack.</p>
<p>Parcel is still in its infancy and I expect a few rough edges in the next months but I would probably give it a shot for my
next project.</p>
<h1 id="it-felt-weird-would-probably-not-do-again">It felt weird (would probably not do again)</h1>
<h2 id="mobx-and-mobx-state-tree">Mobx and mobx-state-tree</h2>
<p>I love <a href="https://mobx.js.org/">mobx</a>. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a reluctant to list it in this category.</p>
<p>It feels simple and powerful and it is written in typescript.</p>
<p>Those were compelling reasons for the choice of this library when I started the project.</p>
<p>I have been working with Redux intensively on a past project and I found it required a lot of design and tools (boilerplate)
to get the simplest features working.</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, we have Mobx. You feel really strong when you design your first stores, because
it just works.</p>
<p>On the other hand, edge cases are rough. Some libraries like react-table would just not behave.</p>
<p>After using it for a year, I can probably list a few rules of thumbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create wrappers using <code>&lt;Observer /&gt;</code> for libraries using <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> aggressively, because they will mess up
with the expectations of the developers</li>
<li>Come up with strategies for serialization and deserialization early in the project with libraries like <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/serializr">seriliazr</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But all of this has a cost in terms of code and mobx has a somewhat hidden learning curve that makes it difficult to grasp for junior
developers.</p>
<p>We also tried <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree/">mobx-state-tree</a> and I love the ideas behind the library.
It comes at a cost, though and this cost, at least for now, <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree/issues/440">is performance</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, choosing a state library for React is hard.</p>
<p>Things to watch for in this area are <a href="https://github.com/mweststrate/immer">immer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated">unstated</a>.</p>
<p>I still do not have the definitive answer to the question of state management in a React application.
Remember there are no silver bullets and be careful when you design your frontend architecture early on.</p>
<h2 id="rest">REST</h2>
<p>I have an idea of what a good rest API looks like.</p>
<p>I think it involves a lot of design and bikeshedding.</p>
<p>When a developer is in charge of a new feature, they always have a lot of choices to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I add attributes to an existing REST resource? (overfetching)</li>
<li>Should I add a new REST resource? (duplication)</li>
<li>Should aggregate resources on the backend or the frontend? (inconsistency)</li>
</ul>
<p>And I did not even talk about HATEOAS or documentation.</p>
<p>Creating a good REST API is definitely something you should strive for and take the time to get right, if your business
model requires it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would consider <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> very seriously.</p>
<p>In our case, our model looked like a tree and not like small separated entities. That&rsquo;s also something to consider.</p>
<p>I feel that thinking your API in terms of a cluster of objects comes more naturally to developers.
It favors emergent design and it encourages your developers and your business to get together and figure out the
<a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html">aggregates</a> in your model.</p>
<p>If you want to go down this road early on and not even bother writing a fully-fledged backend server, I would review
<a href="https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile">postgraphile</a> and <a href="https://www.graph.cool">graphcool</a> as great starting points.</p>
<h2 id="not-using-strict-true-with-typescript">Not using &ldquo;strict: true&rdquo; with typescript</h2>
<p>Typescript is awesome, but you have to enable <a href="https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/options/strictNullChecks.html">strict null checks</a>
to make the most of it.
We started the project without strict checks and it was a significant endeavor to change it, so we never had the time
to do it.</p>
<p>Every time we got an &ldquo;X is undefined&rdquo; error in the frontend, I regretted not adding <code>strict: true</code> to the typescript
configuration at the start of the project.</p>
<h1 id="it-felt-wrong-would-never-do-again">It felt wrong (would never do again)</h1>
<h2 id="using-an-in-memory-database-for-tests-and-development">Using an in memory database for tests and development</h2>
<p>We used Postgres in production and H2 (an in-memory database) for development and tests.</p>
<p>We had too many errors that we could only see after deploying the product to production.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most of them were easy to fix.
The errors we saw the most were differences in ordering and grouping between the two DBMS.</p>
<p>Hence the rule: &ldquo;every SQL query shall have an ORDER BY clause&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Lukas Eder pointed out in the comments:
If you don&rsquo;t need ordering, you should always avoid it, as ordering mostly incurs an O(N log N) operations
(apart from those rather rare cases where you can pull the data directly from an index).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can probably overcome those inconsistencies by setting up a CI build where your tests run against Postgres.</p>
<p>But more importantly, we were not able to take full advantage of features like
<a href="https://blog.jooq.org/2013/11/03/probably-the-coolest-sql-feature-window-functions/">window functions</a> or
<a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/is-postgresql-your-next-json-database/">JSON data types</a>, to name a few.</p>
<p>The next time I&rsquo;m starting a project I will use the same DBMS in development and in production.</p>
<p>I feel that having a little <code>docker-compose.yml</code> at the root of your project, loose a little time (1 second) at the
start of the day to boot it, and having a slightly worst developer experience is well worth the investment.</p>
<h2 id="server-side-rendering">Server-Side Rendering</h2>
<p>When building a Single Page App, you depend on your javascript to create the HTML that the user will interact with.</p>
<p>With Server-Side Rendering (SSR), you ask the server to run the javascript for the page that was requested, and then, send the resulting
HTML directly to your clients.</p>
<p>It is believed that your users will have a better experience with this technique, especially on lower-end devices that
will struggle to process big javascript files.</p>
<p>It is also believed that this wields better SEO results, as it easier for crawlers to parse HTML than to execute javascript.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the project, I was sure I could take advantage of SSR.
I had set up a few projects in JS that leveraged SSR in the past, and studied libraries like
<a href="https://zeit.co/blog/next">nextjs</a> carefully.</p>
<p>On the JVM, it is a bit less common, but I managed to pull something off using <a href="https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8/">J2V8</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is SSR is a trade-off and I think most web applications don&rsquo;t need to invest time in server-rendered
javascript.</p>
<p>Besides, measuring the benefits of SSR is really tricky. You have to consider different metrics than the &ldquo;time to render&rdquo;.
Take, for example, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive">time to interactive</a>.</p>
<p>It is a fascinating subject but it was foolish to spend time on this matter as SEO and slow processors were clearly
not a priority for the business.</p>
<p>Removing Server-Side Rendering was a good call, and reduced the overall complexity of the server code.</p>
<p>That being said, there is room for a tool that would simplify SSR on the JVM. It would be a amazing side project if you&rsquo;re
interested in the challenge.</p>
<h2 id="service-layer">Service layer</h2>
<p>Not spending enough time on the simplest aspect of the architecture was something I came to regret a few months into
the project with multiple people working on the code.</p>
<p>Make sure that every layer has clear boundaries and do not hesitate to split your project in small modules early on.</p>
<p>For example, these modules can be a good starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model</code>: mapping with your database and helpers</li>
<li><code>services</code>: fetching and updating your database, only exports higher-level functions like Graphql endpoints</li>
<li><code>web-backend</code>: things that depend on HTTP libraries</li>
<li><code>web-frontend</code>: JS stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>Modules are a great way to enforce architectural decisions.
Moreover, you can only use the <code>internal</code> <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/visibility-modifiers.html">keyword</a>
in Kotlin by splitting your code into modules.</p>
<p>Later in the project, when you figure out cluster of domain objects that work together well, you should also split the service
layer into smaller modules.</p>
<p>Good examples might be the &ldquo;order module&rdquo;, the &ldquo;transaction module&rdquo;, or the &ldquo;security module&rdquo; depending on your domain.</p>
<p>I like to thing of this approach as a stepping stone towards &ldquo;micro-services&rdquo;, without the complexity of deploying them
as separate network entities.</p>
<p>There is actually a continuum between an integrated system and a distributed system and you probably won&rsquo;t have to
cross the line.</p>
<p>For more insights, I recommend watching the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/axelfontaine/majestic-modular-monoliths">Majestic Modular Monoliths</a>
talk by Axel Fontaine.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Your time is precious, you don&rsquo;t want to be spending it unwisely or come to regret too many engineering decisions later.</p>
<p>Only experience can make you aware of the tradeoffs you will make in the early stages of a product. I hope that
mine will help you avoid some traps and make better choices when designing a greenfield project.</p>

provide the solutions for the remaining problems.</p>
<p>Right now there seems to be a consensus for the best libraries. The recommended stack is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building: <code>Webpack</code> and <code>babel</code></li>
<li>Managing your UI state: <code>Redux</code> and <code>ImmutableJS</code></li>
<li>Routing: <code>React-router</code> (<a href="https://github.com/taion/rrtr">ahem!</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But there seems to be <a href="https://blog.boldlisting.com/connecting-redux-to-your-api-eac51ad9ff89#.s83cs4um8">lots of options</a>
to connect Redux to your API.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I decided to see what <a href="http://shasta.tools/">Shasta</a> had in store for
us. I have to say that I was more than happy with what I saw!</p>
<p>Check out my demo project <a href="https://github.com/geowarin/shasta-preview">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-shasta">What is Shasta?</h2>
<p>Shasta is the latest project of <a href="https://github.com/contra">@Contra (Eric Schoffstall)</a>,
previously known for Gulp.</p>
<p>The idea is to take the best practices and libraries used by the React community
and stitch them together with nice helpers.</p>
<p>It is an <a href="http://shasta.tools/shasta/docs/Opinions.html">opinionated library</a>.</p>
<p>Without surprise, you will find support for all the libraries cited above.</p>
<p>Shasta is very ambitious and aims to help you solve Server Side Rendering, manage
security and user sessions, etc.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/shastajs/boilerplate">shasta-boilerplate</a> for a more comprehensive example.</p>
<p>In this article I will focus on <a href="https://github.com/shastajs/tahoe">Tahoe</a> and
the <a href="https://github.com/shastajs/shasta-data-view">shasta data view</a>.</p>
<p>I think that those two things alone are well worth a blog post!</p>
<h2 id="a-word-of-warning">A word of warning!</h2>
<p>Shasta is under development. All the dependencies in the demo are pointing to the
github repositories. There are no npm releases yet!</p>
<p>Likewise, the documentation <a href="http://shasta.tools/shasta/index.html">is very sparse</a> at
the moment.</p>
<p>Thinks are likely to change or break. You have been warned.</p>
<p>Your best bet to learn more about Shasta right now is to listen to the Javascript Jabber podcast
<a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/205-jsj-shasta-with-eric-schoffstall">episode on Shasta</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-store">The store</h2>
<p>The central element in Shasta is the store.
It is very similar to Redux&rsquo;s store but it adds the notion of plugins.</p>
<p>To get started quickly, I created a project [using nwb]({% post_url 2016-02-18-react-freshness %}).</p>
<p>Here is what the project looks like after setting up Shasta with the router and
Tahoe:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/articles/2016-04-shasta-layout.png"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dig into the core package.</p>
<p><code>store.js</code> allows you to reference the store as a singleton. This is also where
you register the plugins you use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e2e4e5;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">import</span> { createStore, createReducer } from <span style="color:#5af78e">&#39;shasta&#39;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">import</span> localReducers from <span style="color:#5af78e">&#39;../reducers/.lookup&#39;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">import</span> plugins from <span style="color:#5af78e">&#39;./plugins&#39;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">export</span> <span style="color:#ff6ac1">default</span> createStore({
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  plugins<span style="color:#ff6ac1">:</span> plugins,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  reducers<span style="color:#ff6ac1">:</span> [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    createReducer(localReducers)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  ]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>plugins.js</code> is very simple. In this example, I use two plugins, Tahoe and shasta-router:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e2e4e5;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">import</span> <span style="color:#ff6ac1">*</span> as router from <span style="color:#5af78e">&#39;shasta-router&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">import</span> <span style="color:#ff6ac1">*</span> as api from <span style="color:#5af78e">&#39;tahoe&#39;</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">export</span> <span style="color:#ff6ac1">default</span> [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  api,

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="plugins">Plugins</h3>
<p>What are those plugins? Shasta defines multiple extension points.
Most notably, your plugin can export reducers and middlewares which dramatically
help reducing the boilerplate.</p>
<p>With the example above, you will get your routes stored in Redux with <code>react-router-redux</code>,
and the setup for the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en">Redux Devtools chrome extension</a>.</p>
<p>Tahoe also adds a bunch of reducers to handle our API calls.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-the-lookup-file">What about the .lookup file?</h3>
<p>The <code>.lookup</code> files are a really nice idea, they use the <a href="https://github.com/contra/glob-loader">glob-loader</a> to re-export all the js files
according to a glob expression.</p>
<p>This avoids writing repetitive and error prone-code like:</p>

Refresh!</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the javascript community, some people have experienced <a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.4ex2kn77n">javascript fatigue</a>.</p>
<p>For me, this fatigue is two folds.
First, you need to keep up to date with the frantic pace
of redux, react-router and friends and make sure you will be able to migrate your
code to the new major versions.</p>
<p>Second, Webpack configuration is not always straight-forward.
I know a lot of people that really want to see what React is like and play with
it without having to cope with a lot of configuration up-front.</p>
<p>I have no solution for the first problem. To me, innovation in this community feels
like a fantastic thing. Watching the github repos and <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/my-react-list-862227952a8c#.l1p0093pk">following people</a> on Twitter
is my way to keep up-to-date with the latest improvements.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that the most used tools seem to be more and more stable.
It is unlikely that redux or react-router will go through a full rewrite now. So
relax. If you&rsquo;re not able to update your dependencies every two days, it&rsquo;s
probably not the end of the world.</p>
<p>In this article, I will show you two ways to get started with React with <strong>zero</strong>
configuration. So you can start hacking right away when you&rsquo;re still fresh!</p>
<h2 id="quick-prototyping-with-babel-browser-transform">Quick prototyping with babel browser transform</h2>
<p>So you need to get some React code out of the door <strong>now</strong>.
You don&rsquo;t care about hot reloading and want to write some React and ES2015 code
in a web page.</p>
<p>Jim Sproch has <a href="http://www.jimsproch.com/react/">a very cool solution</a> for us.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;/<span style="color:#ff6ac1">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#ff6ac1">html</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And that&rsquo;s about it!
Every script tag with the <code>text/babel</code> type will be transformed with babel.
So you have support for destructuring, arrow functions and, of course, JSX.
It will even work for external scripts so you don&rsquo;t need to write all your
code in the page.</p>
<p>Now, Jim likes to work with the bleeding edge beta of React but you can easily
switch <code>react.js</code> and <code>react-dom</code> with production versions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e2e4e5;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#ff6ac1">script</span> <span style="color:#57c7ff">src</span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">=</span><span style="color:#5af78e">&#34;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.7/react.js&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#ff6ac1">script</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#ff6ac1">script</span> <span style="color:#57c7ff">src</span><span style="color:#ff6ac1">=</span><span style="color:#5af78e">&#34;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.7/react-dom.js&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#ff6ac1">script</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The downside of this solution, of course, is that the transform is executed by the
client&rsquo;s browser so this will be slower than pre-compiled Babel.
And you don&rsquo;t have hot reloading available.</p>
<p>But still, zero config.</p>
<h2 id="a-true-react-project-with-nwb">A true React project with nwb</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/insin/nwb">Nwb</a> will take care of all the webpack and babel configuration.</p>
<p>Install it as a global package:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>npm i -g nwb
</code></pre><p>You can then create a React project:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>nwb new react-app my-nwb-app

It is a very simple application:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>nwb: new react-app

<h3 id="nwb-gotchas">Nwb gotchas</h3>
<p>Nwb has opinions. And that&rsquo;s a good thing.
For example, you write tests with Karma and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Support for Babel 6 is not there yet so it&rsquo;s not completely bleeding edge.</p>
<p>But you can serenely leave the hard part of configuring your app to Nwb.
It&rsquo;s got a very impressive test suite and coverage. You&rsquo;re in good hands!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Feeling fatigued? I do not!
I wish there were more projects like Nwb with strong opinions and one easy
way to do things.</p>
<p>But it is possible to get started with React and even have a production-ready
application with zero configuration.</p>
<p>Never used React? You have no more excuses. Get to work and help this community
improve!</p>

I&rsquo;m also a Spring and groovy addict.</p>
<p>Those two stacks make me more productive.
Can we have the best of both worlds?</p>
<p>I will show you step by step how I created
<a href="https://github.com/geowarin/boot-react">this project</a>.
Feel free to fiddle with it and give me your feedback.</p>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>My perfect stack on the backend is to use Spring boot and groovy.
With the latest version of Spring boot, there is a new tool called
<a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/06/17/devtools-in-spring-boot-1-3">dev-tools</a> that
will automatically reload the embedded server when you recompile your project.</p>
<p>On the frontend, most React developers use <a href="http://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a>.
React has awesome support for hot reloading with <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader">react-hot-loader</a>.
It will magically update your views without requiring you to refresh your browser.
Because React encourages your to have a unidirectional data flow, your whole
application can use hot reloading every time you save.
For this to work, we have to launch a <a href="http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html">webpack dev server</a>.</p>
<p>The problem when you launch your Spring boot server on the port 8080 and the
dev server on the port 3000 is that you will get cross origin requests preventing
the two servers from interacting.</p>
<p>We also want to isolate the two projects and make separate gradle modules.</p>
<p>This blog post will show a solution to this problem and will provide an
enjoyable dev environment.</p>
<p>This might not be the perfect solution and I&rsquo;d love any feedback from
both communities to help me improve it.</p>
<h2 id="the-backend">The backend</h2>
<p>We will generate the backend. To do that, you can go on <a href="http://start.spring.io/">http://start.spring.io/</a>
and create a <strong>gradle project</strong> using <strong>groovy</strong>, <strong>java 8</strong> and the latest Spring boot
(<strong>1.3.0 M2</strong> at the time of writing).</p>
<p>For the dependencies tick <strong>DevTools</strong> and <strong>Web</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to do it command line style just type the following in your console:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
-d name=boot-react  \
-d bootVersion=1.3.0.M2 \
-d dependencies=devtools,web \
-d language=groovy \
-d JavaVersion=1.8 \
-d type=gradle-project \
-d packageName=react \
-d packaging=jar \
-d artifactId=boot-react \
-d baseDir=boot-react | tar -xzvf -
</code></pre><p>This will create a base project with the latest spring boot, the devtools, groovy
and gradle.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to generate the gradle wrapper:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>gradle wrapper
</code></pre><p>See the <a href="https://github.com/geowarin/boot-react/commit/c290269a9e105688b38dcc6cc0b3293ec85199e6">commit</a></p>
<p>Great so now we have tomcat embedded, hot reloading and supernatural groovy
strength. The usual.</p>
<p>We will create a simple REST resource that we would like our frontend to consume:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e2e4e5;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-groovy" data-lang="groovy"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff9f43">@RestController</span>

<p>As mentioned before, we want the frontend to be a separated project.

<p>We will use the <a href="https://github.com/srs/gradle-node-plugin">gradle node plugin</a>
to call the two main tasks in our application:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npm run bundle</code> will create the minified app in the <code>dist</code> directory</li>
<li><code>npm start</code> will start our dev server</li>
</ul>
<p>We can call them from the gradle build with <code>./gradlew frontend:start</code> and
<code>./gradlew frontend:bundle</code></p>
<p>The content of the project will basically be the same as
<a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate">react-hot-boilerplate</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the sources of this project as a zip file from github and unzip them into the
frontend directory.
With bash, type the following command at the root of your project:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>wget -qO- -O tmp.zip https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/archive/master.zip &amp;&amp; unzip tmp.zip &amp;&amp; mv react-hot-boilerplate-master/* frontend &amp;&amp; rm -rf react-hot-boilerplate-master &amp;&amp; rm tmp.zip

<p>If everything goes well, typing <code>./gradlew fronted:start</code>, will start the react
application at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>
<p>The first problem arises when you <code>ctrl+c</code> out of the gradle build,
the server will still hang. You can kill it with <code>killall node</code>.
This is a problem I&rsquo;d like help solving, if you have a solution, please tell me.</p>
<p>In the rest of the article I will use <code>npm start</code> directly, which presupposes that
you have <code>npm</code> available on your development machine.
The whole build will only require Java.</p>
<p>We will use the <a href="https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin">webpack-html-plugin</a>
to automatically generate the index.html page.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
</code></pre><p>Since using the document body as a root for our application is a bad practice,
we need to tweak the default html template.</p>
<p>I created a file called <code>index-template.html</code> in a newly created <code>assets</code> directory.
It will serve as a template to generate our <code>index.html</code> file:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/geowarin/4e6089bc670d753f2453.js"></script>

<p>As you can see, it contains a div with the id <code>root</code>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s tweak the dev server a little bit to <a href="http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#combining-with-an-existing-server">combine it with another server</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change <code>webpack.config.js</code>:</p>

Turnquist. Packt Publishing, the editor, contacted me to review it during its writing but I&amp;rsquo;ll remain as unbiased as possible.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good book, well worth reading if you want to learn how spring boot works but more globally, it will give you good insights and tips on the capabilities of Spring and its integration with other technologies.</description></item></channel></rss>
